        <h1> The Style of Jazz </h1>

            <p> One of the many types of music I like to listen to is Jazz music. As a jazz musician, I enjoy playing and listening to others play. Jazz can be interpretted in many different ways, which makes it very diverse in terms of how music is composed, as well as recieved by an audience. I think that is why I like jazz so much, because there is so much variation within this amazing style.</p>
